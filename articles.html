        <h5 align="left">Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (English: /ˈpʊʃkɪn/;[1] Russian: Александр Сергеевич Пушкин was a Russian poet, playwright, <br>
            and novelist of the Romantic era who is considered by many to be the greatest Russian poet and the founder of modern Russian literature. <br>
            Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His father, Sergey Lvovich Pushkin, belonged to Pushkin noble families. A maternal <br>
            great-grandfather was African-born general Abram Petrovich Gannibal. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized <br>
            by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. Upon graduation from the Lycee, Pushkin recited his <br>
            controversial poem "Ode to Liberty", one of several that led to his being exiled by Tsar Alexander the First. While under the strict surveillance <br>
            of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, <br>
            Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832.</h5>

        <h5 align="left">Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy Russian: Лев Николаевич Толстой, usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is <br>
            regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. He received multiple nominations for Nobel Prize in Literature every year from 1902 to 1906, <br>
            and nominations for Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902 and 1910, and his miss of the prize is a major Nobel prize controversy. <br>
            Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles <br>
            of realist fiction. He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852–1856), <br>
            and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such <br>
            as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859), and Hadji Murad (1912). He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays.</h5>

        <h5 align="left">Anton Pavlovich Chekhov (Russian: Антон Павлович Чехов, was a Russian playwright and short-story writer, who is considered to be among the greatest <br>
            writers of short fiction in history. His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. <br>
            Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. <br>
            Chekhov practiced as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career: "Medicine is my lawful wife", he once said, "and literature is my mistress." <br>
            Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski's Moscow <br>
            Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard. These four works <br>
            present a challenge to the acting ensemble[7] as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a "theatre of mood" and a "submerged life in the text".</h5>
